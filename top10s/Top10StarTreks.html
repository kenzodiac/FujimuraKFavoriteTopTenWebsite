        <h2>#10) Star Trek: Picard</h2>
          <p>Aired: 2020-2023</p>
          <p>“Jean-Luc is back! Definitely not better than ever but we'll take what we can get.” -Amar
          </p>
          <p>“I am biased enough that I don’t dislike hardly any Star Treks. And I enjoy <i>Star Trek: Picard</i> more than most people seem to. But it  is at the bottom of our list because it’s a very uneven endeavor. Sometimes, it’s in ways that I appreciate as trying to do something different and interesting regarding shaking up franchise conventions. It is very clearly an ambitious show. But as a sequel to something beloved, it leaves a lot of things lacking. Even the characters and plot points that I find interesting, the show never seems to have the time to sit and really explore those thoroughly the repercussions of before moving on to something else invariably less interesting. Still, there’s high production values, and getting to watch Patrick Stewart reprise a character he’s sworn up and down for decades that he’d never do, is enough to keep me happy. And there’s a lot of interesting world building happening in the background that later Star Trek shows can explore. “PIC” has a final season coming in a matter of months, hopefully it learns from the growing pains of the first two and serves as a good send-off for a series that never got a satisfying one.” -Ken

        <h2>#9) Star Trek: Prodigy</h2>
        <p>Aired: 2021-Present</p>
          <p>“Star Trek for kids? Not at all. Don't sleep on this banger.” -Amar</p>
          <p>"<i>Star Trek: Prodigy</i> is first and foremost an animated kid’s show. So some of the stories are a little simple. But it’s still a very good time in my estimation. It never condescends to its audience and its story is strong and interesting enough that most adults can enjoy it without any caveats. It’s made by people who very clearly have immense amounts of knowledge and admiration for the franchise. And its strong thematic and story links to <i>Star Trek: Voyager</i> gives long-time fans a lot of latch onto. As a show, it’s got a strong ethical/moral compass while not feeling like it’s preaching too much. And being an animated show, it’s free from the constraints of live action filming so that it can show the viewer truly bizarre locations and aliens that really push the limits of exploring imagination in ways that Star Trek always pays lip-service to, but doesn’t always deliver on. We’re most of the way through its first season and so far, so good. If it can keep up this strong, early momentum, it might eventually find itself moving up this list." -Ken</p>

          <h2>#8) Star Trek: Discovery</h2>
          <p>Aired: 2017-Present</p>
            <p>“A decade in the making and actually lived up to the hype. Disco might have single handedly saved the franchise.” -Amar</p>
            <p>"‘Disco’ is a very interesting, if eclectic mess of a show. It had a carousel of showrunners early on that took the show in very different directions in each of its early seasons, leading to a bit of a hodgepodge of ideas stuck together that didn’t quite always fit with each other. But despite that, there’s a lot to love here with <i>Star Trek: Discovery</i>. The production values on the show are top notch, like watching a theatrical film with every episode. There’s a lot of compelling storylines and interesting characters/scenarios that are welcome additions to the broad canon that makes up this expansive franchise. And its persistent, long-running themes of focusing on mental health and embracing the diverse expressions of emotions and humanity are possibly too progressive for even Star Trek fans to fully consider. Most Star Trek shows historically have had very rough first couple of seasons before they found their voices and ironed out the kinks, and ‘DIS’ is no different in that sense. Every season has gotten better than the last and it’s been a treat to watch the show slowly find its voice over the past four seasons. I’m looking forward to where the show goes from here. And at the very least, every Star Trek fan - even if they don’t like the show - owes it a debt of gratitude for reviving what was essentially a completely dead franchise." -Ken</p>

        <h2>#7) Star Trek: Lower Decks</h2>
        <p>Aired: 2020-Present</p>
          <p>“TNG meets Rick and Morty. Come for memes, stay for the adventures. LD rarely disappoints.” -Amar</p>
          <p>"<i>Star Trek: Lower Decks</i> gets billed as Rick and Morty meets Star Trek, but I think that’s overly reductive and honestly not very real. It might have a similar sense of humor at times, but Rick and Morty has a very strong, misanthropic streak to it. And Lower Decks is the polar opposite. It’s almost relentlessly hopeful, joyous, and wholesome regarding its outlook for humanity. In that sense it’s a true Star Trek show to its very core, always keeping the franchise’s ethos foremost at the center. Its sense of humor might be YMMV, but I find it hitting with me very frequently. And I think the show is wonderful for exploring the Star Trek universe from an angle we very rarely see it from: low ranking officers who are doing grunt-work. It adds a surprising amount of texture to the setting! We’ve got three seasons of this show under our belts now, and I’m loving the show more and more with each one." -Ken</p>

          <p>Aired: 2022-Present</p>
            <p>“New Trek for people that like old Trek. SNW ditches the action packed formula of Disco in favor of more traditional self-contained episodes. No spin-off hangover here.” -Amar</p>
            <p>"<i>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</i> is the newest Star Trek show, and so far it might be the best of this new, modern era. It’s very intentionally trying to style itself after classic shows in form and function, but it also is just a really good modern TV show as well. It looks great; it’s got good character development of a very likable cast, and it’s got a good mix of new and familiar to be very comfortable and enjoyable for any Star Trek fans: old or new, casual or the most zealot of fans. It’s a great introduction to the franchise as well, which has historically been kind of a hard thing to figure out where to direct new fans who are interested but not sure. Lots of Star Trek is very YMMV because of the nature of the franchise, or how slow moving many episodes can be. But ‘SNW’ is a general audience pleaser and anyone can have fun with it." -Ken</p>

        <h2>#5) Star Trek: Enterprise</h2>
        <p>Aired: 2001-2005</p>
          <p>“Scott Bakula is bae. Jolene Blalock is bae. After you finish the series make sure to catch up with the fan-fiction.” -Amar</p>
          <p">"<i>Star Trek: Enterprise</i> used to be a blacksheep of the franchise. It was the last show of the ‘Golden Era’ and its cancellation spelled the end of Star Trek on TV for well over a decade. Its nature as a prequel turned many people off at first, and by the early 2000s, there was some definite “franchise fatigue” affecting ratings. Franchise fatigue was such a worry for the producers that the title of the show was originally just ‘Enterprise’ with ‘Star Trek’ appended years after the fact. But ‘ENT’ has a lot going for it. It feels like a modern show with its serialized stories, and it has several long-form story arcs that are some of the best moments in the entire franchise. The cast is a little top-heavy, but its main three characters are some of Star Trek’s finest and most likable/interesting. And while some franchises might flub being a prequel, ENT actually excels. The production/set design really looks visually like an era that is a transitionary step between IRL modern astronauts, and the more established futurism look of later Star Trek shows. It’s only four seasons, but really begins hitting its stride around the third and it’s a shame it got canceled before being able to do more." -Ken</p>

          <h2>#4) Star Trek (The Original Series)</h2>
          <p>Aired: 1966-1969</p>
            <p>“More fun than a barrel of Tribbles! TOS sparked the imaginations of nerds everywhere for years to come.” -Amar</p>
            <p>"<i>Star Trek ‘The Original Series’</i> is old and antiquated at this point. It was cheap looking when it came out, and it’s full of meme-worthy cheesy performances. But if you can get through the 60s aesthetics, and some completely out-of-date misogyny, it actually holds up pretty well as a show. There’s a lot of real classic episodes that are still to this day, very well written. And when William Shatner is on point and not over-indulging himself, he’s actually a really talented actor. It’s legitimately good! There’s a reason why this show spawned one of the largest, most enduring icons of pop culture in the last century. But even if you can’t get past that, there’s still tons of ironic-watch value in seeing some cheesy, poorly choreographed fights, or watching grown men cower in fear from a poorly made prop. Objectively it probably should be lower on this list, but there’s a lot of nostalgia wrapped up in this show for old fans like myself. And I also count the subsequent film sequels here in TOS as a consideration. And the original six Star Trek movies are, to this day, <i>my</i> Star Trek and what defines the franchise to me." -Ken</p>

        <h2>#3) Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</h2>
        <p>Aired: 1993-1999</p>
          <p>“Boring AF when I was a kid. <em><strong>SO GOOD</strong></em> as an adult. Rewatch this if you used to be an idiot.” -Amar</p>
          <p>"<i>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i> was a show I didn’t appreciate as a kid. I didn’t like that it was set on a space station locked in place, instead of galavanting from planet to planet. I didn’t like the aesthetics of the show either. It just didn’t <i>feel</i> like Star Trek that I was used to. Coming back to it as an adult with new perspectives, I’ve really flipped a 180 on it. There’s so much to like here! The cast/characters are actually incredible. Maybe even the best in the franchise. The long-form storytelling that happens in later seasons is very much ahead of its time. And the show’s transition into a proper Space Opera oriented around a giant galactic war is very unique for the franchise. Avery Brooks as the lead presents a masterclass in acting, and the show itself served as a priceless look at positive fatherly role models for many people. DS9 is a classic." -Ken</p>

          <h2>#2) Star Trek: Voyager</h2>
          <p>Aired: 1995-2001</p>
            <p>“The Delta Quadrant. The Rock. Lizard Babies. Voyager was Star Trek on steroids. Sprinkle in some Borg and Q's and you have one heck of a ride.” -Amar</p>
            <p>"<i>Star Trek: Voyager</i> is comfort food of the finest quality. It didn’t have any grand ambitions to be something completely new, or to fully capitalize on its unique scenario, and many fans might hold that against the show. But for what it was - which is more classic Star Trek - it does a hell of a job at doing that well. All its characters are likable, all of Star Trek’s best tropes and themes are here and finely honed. And there’s a lot of great, crowd-pleasing action interspersed throughout. Kate Mulgrew is a champion of her craft, and for me personally, she was my “TV mom” growing up and a deeply influential role model. Voyager might not be the flashiest Star Trek or the most original, but it’s one I find myself returning to more often than others when I need something comforting and enjoyable when I need my spirits lifted." -Ken</p>

        <p>Aired: 1987-1994</p>
          <p>“No contest. Bald Captain best Captain. I would follow Jean-Luc into the dark void of space any day.” -Amar</p>
          <p>"<i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> is the Star Trek I grew up on. It’s what I bonded with my mother while watching as a little kid. All of its characters were very likable and great role models. I took up the trombone in grade school band because Commander Riker played the trombone in the show. I took Speech and Debate class in high school because I wanted to be as eloquent of a speaker as Picard. The show deeply informed my worldview and morality in ways very few other things or people have. I grew up thirsting to learn and explore because that’s what they did in ‘TNG’. I can’t really be objective with this show. I think there are probably better Star Trek shows than TNG, but TNG exists in that perfect nostalgia zone where all people aged 7-9 are just beginning to learn to be sentient beings and are very impressionable, and the things we grew up loving in that time zone will always be a part of us." -Ken</p>
