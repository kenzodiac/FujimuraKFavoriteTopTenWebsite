          <h2>#7) Front Mission 3</h2>
          <p>Released: March 23rd, 2000<br>
            System: PlayStation<br>
            Developer: Squaresoft</p>
            <p>“Final Fantasy Tactics on crack!” -Amar</p>
            <p>"I love 'Tactical RPGs' and to me, Front Mission 3 is one of the greatest ever made. Tactical RPGs function in similar ways to more traditional RPGs like Final Fantasy, except there's battlefield strategy element to it. You have to not just attack enemies, but you have to manage your positioning dynamically and take terrain into account. If you shoot at a person who is uphill from you or there is an obstacle between you and your opponent, your accuracy might decrease. If you let an opponent flank you, they might deal more damage hitting you from behind. Every character has different strengths and weaknesses, and you have to keep those in mind to be the most successful in battle.</p>
            <p>As a 'Role Playing Game' there's also a pretty involved story in this game, and that's where <i>Front Mission 3</i> shines. Most games have very linear stories that go through a predetermined sequence of events. Sometimes there's granulation in certain events where you can get different outcomes, but those events rarely affect the story in the long run. FM3 does a much better job of making its choices feel meaningful. There are playable characters you can recruit to your team that you have to make the right decisions in order to recruit, otherwise they might perish. And very early in the game (within the first hour or so) there's a branch in the story where the story completely diverges. The story path is so radically different it's basically like getting two completely different games in one. It gives <i>Front Mission 3</i> a level of replayability that most RPGs generally lack. And it's really fascinating to play it on a second playthough, when that different story path often takes you to the other side of a conflict and getting to see in-person the complexities of warfare. Bitter enemies are suddenly allies, and you can begin to see their motivations and different sides of their personalities/lives. It's very affecting to have to kill an enemy in battle who, in your previous playthrough, was a staunch and loveable ally, purely because of a change in chance circumstances.</p>
            <p>Also robots. Big, fighting, customizable robots. Robots kick butt, and FM3's are real dope." -Ken</p>

            <h2>#6) Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors</h2>
            <p>Released: December 10th, 2009<br>
                System: Nintendo DS<br>
                Developer: Chunsoft<br></p>
                <p>"<i>Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors</i> or "999" is a "Visual Novel" - a type of video game that is chiefly concerned with telling a story. Most of the time you spend playing a visual novel, or "VN" is going to be spent reading text (or listening to dialog in ones with larger budgets). It's where it gets its name, it's essentially a novel that has the benefit of being in a visual medium where the game can supplement the text with a bunch of images and animtaions.</p>
                <p>If that sounds dry to you, then it probably will be! There's limited interactivity in 999, so if you're a gamer that needs to be constantly interacting with your games, you might get bored. But if you're looking for an enthralling, dramatic, thriller of a story, 999 has you covered. The scenario of the story might be familiar to many horror movie fans. Your point-of-view character wakes up - a kidnapping victim - and is trapped in a rundown building filled with deadly trapped and forced to work together with other strangers in order to find an escape. Intersperced in the story is classic "Escape Room" puzzles, where the player will find themselves locked in a room, and having to scour the room to solve puzzles that will lead to their escape. If you're a fun of clever logic games, 999 will give your brain some food for thought.</p>
                <p>The story of 999 itself is one of the biggest selling points. Most horror or thriller stories are pretty simple. But 999 relies on a lot of psychological horror. Is there a killer/traitor in your midsts? If someone mysteriously ends up dead, who would benefit from that? Who had the opportunity to do so? Playing 999 is like a mix between "Clue" and "Saw" where you're constantly trying to solve both the physical puzzles you encounter, as well as the psychological puzzles of all the intrigue and violence you're encountering. And the best part of 999 is, if you think you've got everything figured out, you probably don't. There are genuine twists and curveballs that the game throws at its players that will leave most players walking away very impressed for being so thorougly duped. And one of it feels like an 'ass-pull' for lack of a better term. All of the hints are usually there right in front of the player, there is just some very clever and unorthodox mysteries. If you like gripping stories, 999 (and its sequels!) are games you owe it to yourself to play." -Ken</p>

          <h2>#5) Halo: Combat Evolved</h2>
          <p>Released: November 15th, 2001<br>
            System: Xbox<br>
            Developer: Bungie</p>
            <p>“<em>Wizard. Punching Only. Killed by the guardians.</em> Halo single handedly made console LAN parties a thing and set the bar on multiplayer gaming for decades to come” -Amar</p>
            <p>“<i>Halo’s</i> mechanics might not have held up over the years, and some of it is very imbalanced for the purpose of multiplayer, and the story might as well not exist. But it’s still a game I have very fond memories of. I grew up a PC gamer, but in those days PC gaming was very inaccessible for most of my peers. <i>Halo</i> was a kind of democratization of first person shooters for my friend group in a way no other console games previously could match. Not everyone could afford gaming rigs, but they could get an Xbox. And since it had robust split-screen support, you didn’t even need that! You just needed a friend with a second or fourth controller. “LAN parties” used to be far and few between, and had to be very carefully planned events prior to <i>Halo</i>. But all it would take was a few friends on the same page to throw their xbox and controllers into a bag, and then drive over to a meeting place to game the night away. There are very few multiplayer experiences I’ve ever had that have reached the pinnacles of doing a Halo LAN party. Over twenty years later, my friends and I are still chasing those highs.” -Ken</p>

            <h2>#4) Metal Gear Solid</h2>
            <p>Released: September 3rd, 1998<br>
                System: PlayStation<br>
                Developer: Konami Computer Entertainment Japan<br></p>
                <p>“<em>“Snake.. Snake.. SNAAAKE!!!!”</em> Sneaky sneaky hide in a boxy. MG somehow made it fun not to just shoot everything in sight.” -Amar</p>
                <p>“<i>Metal Gear Solid</i> is maybe the best game of its generation. It looks dated and silly to today’s standards, but it’s very much the progenitor of countless trends and was a real trailblazer for video games. The game’s incorporation of a more cinematic experience, its nuanced combat system that lets the players tackle dilemmas with a smorgasbord of options, its story ripped from big Hollywood blockbusters, there are few games as important and influential to the history of gaming as MGS1.</p>

                <p><i>Metal Gear Solid</i> is a “Tactical Espionage Action” game. Where the player takes on the role of an elite soldier, tasked with infiltrating a heavily defended military compound. Stealth and sneaking is the game’s raison d'être, and loud/brazen fighting is often actively punished. Ammo is finite; enemies are strong. And it’s much easier to wait, observe, and sneak around a pack of bad guys versus fighting them head-on. It was a paradigm shift in game design that opened the doors to all kinds of gameplay innovations and genres that to that time felt very stale and predictable.</p>

                <p><i>Metal Gear Solid</i> also has a very bombastic, highly entertaining story to it. There are colorful villains that chomp at the scenery through a mix of camp and badass dramatics. But there’s also a more thoughtful story underneath, that attempted to engage players with pertinent, current, geopolitical issues in ways most games had previously had very little ambition regarding engaging with social commentary and meaningful literary themes. Some of its sequels might be easier for newer gamers to get into, but MGS1 is still a landmark title that most ‘gamers’ ought to try at least once in their lives.” -Ken</p>

          <h2>#3) Suikoden II</h2>
          <p>Released: August 31st, 1999<br>
            System: PlayStation<br>
            Developer: Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo<br></p>
            <p>"RPGs are my favorite genre of games, and <i>Suikoden II</i> is the best RPG in existence, hands down. It’s got many strengths as a game, but most of them are oriented around the game’s expansive, layered, geopolitical story. In <i>Suikoden II</i>, the main character starts out as a teenage soldier, who in the opening moments, finds themself a victim of a false-flag operation that’s used as an excuse for his country to invade its neighbors. Very quickly, the main character finds themself swept up in a whirlwind of events that sees the as the nexus of an effort to unify a collection of diverse and disparate city states in a bid for survival to fend off a genocidal invasion.

            If that sounds wide in scope, it’s because it is. S2 goes to great trouble to make this world feel like a lived in place, with multiple unique regions that all have a history and relationship with each other. You’re not just fighting armies either, you’re essentially statecrafting. Building alliances that hopefully will turn into more permanent bonds for longer term security. This is exemplified in the player’s recruitable entourage. Most RPGs will have you run around with a party of a half-dozen or a dozen characters. Suikoden games let the player recruit at least 108 unique characters, all different in their own interesting ways. Some don’t partake in battle, but give you other advantages like opening an armory for your burgeoning nation. Others might be weak in regular combat, but are strong leaders on large battle confrontations. And all of them have origins and stories that help flesh out the world they occupy.
                
            If you have ever enjoyed traditional console RPGs, don’t overlook the Suikoden games. And <i>Suikoden II</i> still to this day, stands as the best one of them all.” -Ken

              <p>“Zelda is a pretty cool guy. Except when he's breaking into houses, smashing pots, and stealing rupees. This is basically GTA for kids.” -Amar</p>
              <p>Amar and I wanted to limit ourselves to just one game from a franchise in order to give this list more variety. And <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> franchise is one of the big reasons why. Every Zelda game is fun and special, but this one became the backbone of the franchise going forward, and felt the most classic/quintessential to us. It’s served as a blueprint for every subsequent Zelda game, and did the most to make the setting of Hyrule feel like a lived-in world filled with colorful characters. Even today, the gameplay mechanics are still snappy and work exquisitely. And even if the graphics haven’t aged the best, it’s still abstract and stylized enough that it looks way better than most of its peers from that era. Almost a perfect gaming experience, everyone should play OoT.” -Ken</p>

            <p>“Everyone has a favorite Mario game, and <i>Super Mario 64</i> is mine. I was never actually fond of the NES and SNES Mario games. They just never seemed to click with me and I was always terrible at them. But Mario 64 is where that happened. It’s still a near flawless game. And the responsiveness of controlling Mario is just genuinely a delight in itself, nevermind all of the broad experiences you can have while playing the game. Still to this day, I’ve never beaten any of the 2D Mario games, but Mario 64 was enthralling enough for me to 100% it. Any game that inspires me to explore every nook and cranny without fatigue is going to be a good time. And its cartoon styling still looks great multiple decades later. Mario 64 is one for the ages.” -Ken
